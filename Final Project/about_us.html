        <h1>About Our Cake Shop</h1>
        <p>Alma's Cake Shop first opened business in 2003 in San Juan, Texas. Staff concisted of Alma, an old friend, and Alma's son. The
           three would start to run the shop for well over a year, gaining a good traction of customers as time passed.</p>
        <p>After a year of hard work and happy customers, demand for Alma's cakes rose to the point where three people could not
           run the shop to it's full potential, especially with the old equipment that they would use. With the money that they had made
           and saved up, they expanded the shop, hired more people, bought delivery vans and bought more and better cooking equipment 
           to meet everyone's sweet tooth demands.</p>
        <p>Because of the big upgrade in the cake shop, they could now handle organizations, schools and events to make multiple cakes
           of all kinds of flavors, big or small, and deliver them to their intended destination.</p>
        <p>Fast foward to today, after 10 years (as of writing this), we have sold countless cakes to many hungry customers and 
           served multiple organizations, school events, private parties, and even charities.</p>
